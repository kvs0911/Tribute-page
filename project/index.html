        <h2>About Pythagoras</h2>
        <p>Pythagoras was a Greek mathematician and philosopher who lived from around 570 BCE to 495 BCE. He is best
            known for his contributions to mathematics, particularly the Pythagorean Theorem, but he also had a
            significant impact on philosophy, music theory, and astronomy.</p>
        <p>Pythagoras was born on the island of Samos and later moved to Croton in southern Italy, where he founded a
            school called the Pythagorean Brotherhood. The Pythagoreans were known for their belief in the importance of
            numbers and their mystical properties, and their teachings were influential in the development of Western
            mathematics and philosophy.</p>

        <h2>The Pythagorean Theorem</h2>
        <p>The Pythagorean Theorem is named after Pythagoras, although it is possible that he was not the first to
            discover it. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse
            (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two
            sides.</p>

                <div class="triangle-leg"></div>
                <div class="triangle-leg"></div>
                <div class="triangle-hypotenuse"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="formula">
                <p><span>c</span><sup>2</sup> = <span>a</span><sup>2</sup> + <span>b</span><sup>2</sup></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Although the Pythagorean Theorem is a simple concept, it has many practical applications in fields such as
            architecture, engineering, and physics. It is also a fundamental concept in Euclidean geometry.</p>

        <h2>Legacy of Pythagoras</h2>
        <p>Pythagoras is remembered today for his contributions to mathematics and philosophy, as well as his influence
            on later thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle. His ideas about the importance of numbers and their mystical
            properties were influential in the development of Western mathematics and philosophy, and the Pythagorean
            Theorem remains one of the most well-known and widely used mathematical concepts.</p>
